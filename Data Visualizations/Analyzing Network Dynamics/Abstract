In this project, I delve into the complexities of a vast big-data dataset to uncover meaningful insights and trends. By leveraging several visualization tools and techniques in Python, I transformed raw data into intuitive and compelling visual representations. The project aimed not only to present information but also to facilitate a deeper understanding of intricate patterns within the dataset. Through interactive visualizations, stakeholders gain the ability to explore and analyze data dynamically, fostering informed decision-making. This project not only showcases my proficiency in handling large datasets, but also demonstrates the power of visual storytelling in conveying complex information to a broad audience.

The data I worked with included firewall logs for a large corporation. By digging into the data and creating interactive visualizations, I was able to uncover certain security breaches during April of 2009.

# UT-Fall-2023
This repository consists of major projects and assignments I completed at the University of Texas at Austin during my Fall 2023 semester. Each project presents knowledge of analytical practices as well as technical skills to provide information from data.

## Optimizations and Decision Making (BAX 358)
In this course, I learned several optimization methods for decision-making, covering diverse quantitative techniques such as 
1) Linear Programming
2) Integer Programming
3) Non-linear Programming

This course taught me how to use a **Python** optimization solver, **Gurobi**, to solve a variety of decision-making problems with practical applications in finance, marketing, and revenue management. With knowledge of optimization theory and programming using Gurobi, I can confidently tackle various optimization problems.

## Data Visualizations (CS 329E)
In this course, I gained a foundational understanding of key design principles and techniques for creating interactive data visualizations, using **Python**. I learned how visual representations enhance the analysis of complex data, and explored the design and implementation of effective visualizations using modern frameworks such as the following packages in **Python**:
1) Matplotlib.pyplot
2) Seaborn
3) Altair
4) Networkx

This course significantly improved my skills in designing and implementing interactive data visualizations, providing a valuable overview of visualization techniques. The end of the course involved developing a substantial visualization project, enhancing my proficiency in tackling real-world challenges with impactful visualizations.

## Information and Analysis (MKT 360)
This course equipped me with essential methods, principles, and theories crucial in modern marketing research. By delving into practical business settings, I learned the concepts and terminology used in the realm of marketing research. The course empowered me with methodological tools, providing a competitive edge in leveraging research for strategic decision-making in the business world. Some of these tools include:
1) Surveying / Experimentation
2) Hypothesis testing
3) Regression / Advanced regression
4) Conjoint analysis
5) Cluster analysis / Factor analysis

This course improved my knowledge of industry standards for designing surveys and experiments, as well as introduced new data collection methods. I was able to combine my prior programming knowledge with the theoretical knowledge from this course to perform an in-depth marketing analysis on a local coffee chain.
